## Example

```python
from factpulse.models.afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data import AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData from a JSON string
afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data_instance = AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data_dict = afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData from a dict
afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data_from_dict = AFNORFacilityPayloadHistoryUleB2gAdditionalData.from_dict(afnor_facility_payload_history_ule_b2g_additional_data_dict)
